TutorEase is an online learning platform specifically designed for Java programming students and tutors. It aims to provide a user-friendly and interactive environment where learners of all levels—beginner, intermediate, and advanced—can enhance their programming skills. The platform offers key features such as tutor and student registration, session scheduling, resource sharing, and real-time class sessions with audio, video, and screen-sharing capabilities. Admins play a critical role in managing tutor applications, monitoring student registrations, and maintaining system operations. The platform ensures a structured learning experience by allowing tutors to upload resources like notes and videos, which can be accessed only by their assigned students. Additionally, students can book one-on-one tutoring sessions, facilitating personalized learning.

The system is built using a three-tier architecture, consisting of a React-based frontend, a Java Spring Boot backend, and a MySQL database for storing user information, session details, and learning resources. Real-time communication is powered by WebSocket and WebRTC, enabling seamless interactions between tutors and students. The platform prioritizes performance, ensuring fast page load times, compatibility with major web browsers, and adherence to coding standards for maintainability. Admins receive notifications for tutor registrations and can approve or reject applications, ensuring a controlled onboarding process. With its structured approach and advanced features, TutorEase effectively bridges the gap between students and experienced Java tutors, enhancing the online learning experience.
